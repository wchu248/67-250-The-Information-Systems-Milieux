# 67-250: The Information Systems Milieux

## Web Development Project

For this project, we were assigned a Web Development Project. We had to create a mock website that featured Prantl's Bakery, a bakery located in Pittsburgh. 

We were tasked with implementing a fully functional website that served as an alternative to the current Prantl's site. We had to follow certain criteria such as having an HTML table, a contact inquiry form, interactive pictures, and more. 

For the initial step, we had to create wireframes for our website, which were layouts for each page. We then had to write user stories, which we had to be able to fulfill in our website. From there, I wrote code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the website, design it, and link the pages together with working functions.  

The zip file is included in the file tree and contains pictures of the wireframes, a design paragraph, and a table of the user stories.

## Database Project

For this project, we had to take on the role of an IS Analyst at the Bentley Motors Limited company. We were provided with a database and had to produce multiple things from it. First, we had to create an elementary ERD that held various assumptions. We then created data dictionaries with data types, descriptions, and example data. Multiple simple SQL queires and their corresponding tables were also included in our project, which helped us identify certain parts of the company, such as the average selling price of vehicles, the most popular Bentley model, and the best salesperson. A mock business memo to the managers at Bentley offered a suggestion to expand a certain dealership, with graphs and charts to help solidify the information I was giving them. 

The data was provided by our professor and put onto a MySQL database, which was easily accessed on the Internet. The SQL queries are alongside their table counterparts to clearly show what each query resulted in. 

The project is contained in a single PDF file that includes all of the above.
