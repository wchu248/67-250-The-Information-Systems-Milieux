# Web Development Project

For my Information Systems Milieux class, we were assigned a Web Development Project. We had to create a mock website that featured Prantl's Bakery, a bakery located in Pittsburgh. 

We were tasked with implementing a fully functional website that served as an alternative to the current Prantl's site. We had to follow certain criteria such as having an HTML table, a contact inquiry form, interactive pictures, and more. 

For the initial step, we had to create wireframes for our website, which were layouts for each page. We then had to write user stories, which we had to be able to fulfill in our website. From there, I wrote code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the website, design it, and link the pages together with working functions.  

The zip file is included in the file tree and contains pictures of the wireframes, a design paragraph, and a table of the user stories.
